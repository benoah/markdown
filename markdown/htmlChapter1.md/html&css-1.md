### Introduction

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Any website you visit has been created with the use of HTML and every webpage is an html file. As it is the backbone of website creation, it is a relatively easy (and powerful!) concept to learn. Here is a classic example of what HTML looks like:

`<html>`
` <head>`
`<title>My Page Title</title>`
`</head>`
`<body>`

This is where all my web page content goes!

`</body>`
`</html>`

Throughout this course we will be looking at HTML in more detail and exactly how it works in the creation of a website. But firstly, know that HTML is made up of a number of short codes typed into a text-file by the creator of a site. These codes are known as tags. When the text is saved as an html file and opened by a browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.), the browser translates the text into the webpage that was intended to be created. Let's see what text editors we can use to start creating a website.

# Text Editors

> Using a proper HTML text editor allows you to differentiate parts of code using colors and spacing, and it also allows you to click on tags and find their corresponding tags. This can be very helpful on larger documents. Text editors also assist you in finding errors in your code, and make it easier to search through your code.

# File and folder management

### 1. Keep like files together

### 2. Break it down

### 3. Keep the folder names short and descriptive

### 4. Maintain a hierarchy
