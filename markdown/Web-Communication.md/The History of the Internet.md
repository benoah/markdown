### The History of the Internet

> In 1957, The Soviet Union launched Sputnik – the first orbital satellite – which changed the “space race” between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now there was an "eye in the sky" – a satellite that could transmit and receive information around the globe.
> Computers were used during WWII for very specific purposes – as enormous calculating machines. They were used to calculate missile trajectories and to crack encoded information. They were built with vacuum tubes rather than microprocessors, were extremely expensive, and - because they were based on tubes - they would break down frequently.

### Transitor

> Instead of building a circuit with a number of distinct components, an integrated circuit could be created with all the required components in place.

> Transistors used a newly developed semiconducting material instead of vacuum tubes. This resulted in electrical components that were smaller, cheaper, and more reliable than tube technology. The transistor gained commercial traction in the mid-1950s, and ushered in an area of "transistorised" devices that included radios, television, and yes, computers.

### Microprocessors

> The personal computer was a departure from the mainframe model we mentioned earlier. This was in part due to the development of microprocessors. The microprocessor was a collection of components, built on the same circuit, that would provide all the necessary functionality of a computer. This led to components that were considerably cheaper to produce and became widely used in all different types of applications.
