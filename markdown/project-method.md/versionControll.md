# Version Control

- Firstly, a VCS remembers the history of your files. If you make a mistake, you can get an earlier version back again. Secondly, a VCS helps you share changes. It makes things easier to manage if several of you are working together, or if you are working in more than one location.

## Tracking changes

- Given that a VCS is based around a single concept, it does the job of tracking changes occurring within files or directories. Based on the version control system being used, this could vary from knowing about the file being changed to knowing about certain characters of bytes in a file that were changed.

- In most conditions, you point out a directory or a group of files that you wish to track changes in via version control. This can be done by cloning or checking out a repository from a host, or by manually informing the software of the files you wish to track via VCS. The group of directories or files that are being tracked by VCS are known as a repository. As changes are made, the VCS will track every such change behind the curtains and the process will seem transparent to you until you feel it is the right time to commit the changes made.

- Committing
  If the files you are working on are under version control, each change you make will be automatically tracked.
