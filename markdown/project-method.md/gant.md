# Gantt Charts

- They also allow you to come up with practical aspects of a project, such as the minimum time required to finish the project, what tasks are pre-requisites for other tasks, and so on. Moreover, you can also use them to figure out the critical path or the series of tasks which must be finished on time individually in order to ensure that the project is delivered on time.

- To conclude, you can always also use Gantt charts to keep the sponsors and team members involved in the project updated . All you are supposed to do is update the chart and display the schedule changes along with their implications, or simply use it to share around the key tasks that were successfully completed.

### Gantt chart advantages

1. Circumvent completion confusion: Gantt charts allow users to stay on track by granting a visual timeline displaying the start and finish for each task. Since the key dates and milestones are all noticeable on the visual overview of these charts, it becomes easier to maintain timescale-based tasks and deliverables as they can be tracked on a yearly, monthly, weekly or even a daily basis. The diagram given below shows the benefit of visualization offered by Gantt charts:

2. Keeping everyone on the same page: Whenever a visual framework for a certain project exists, the chances of misunderstanding and other related conflicts lower substantially. Thanks to Gantt charts, every shareholder receives the same set of information and can declare mutually understood expectations, allowing developers to carry out their tasks in accordance with the protocol.
3. Acknowledging task relationships: The charts improve transparency by clearly displaying interrelation between various tasks and which tasks rely on the completion of another to achieve a certain objective. These task relationships can be hard to understand, as they require one to understand the accurate timing of each task and the way one task impacts the other, along with their interdependence. With Gantt charts, one can assure the best workflow as task relationships become easier to understand, improving productivity and success rates.
4. Effective resource allocation: With one glance at the Gantt chart, users can distinguish between resource locations and hence be able to allocate or share resources effectively, utilizing the available resources to their fullest extent. The better one manages to study and follow the chart, the better the chances of them being able to keep project costs under the given budget and ensure on-time completion.
5. Get a handle on the future: Gantt charts not only allow one to focus on day-to-day progress. They allow project managers to look much further ahead in order to make decisions and make sure the project is heading towards the right direction, i.e. in accordance with the companyâ€™s long-term strategic objectives.
