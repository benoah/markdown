# Computers

- ### The first computers were designed by engineers to be used by engineers. There was little consideration for ease of use, as computers were not intended for laymen; they were intended strictly for specialist use.\_

- In California, the Xerox/Palo Alto research facility was exploring a computer interface for children. Among the developments were many of the user interface elements we take for granted today. This included the mouse/pointer device, as well as interface elements such as windows, buttons and scrollbars, among others.

- Apple Computer was one of the first companies to implement these technologies in a personal computer. Soon after, Microsoft launched their Windows operating system. Since that time, more and more focus has been put on the user interface. With the advent of smart phones and wearable technology, user interface has, if anything, become more critical.

- There is another acronym that may be introduced here – WIMP, which stands for "Window, Icon, Menu, Pointer" – these four elements are present in lots of different GUIs. But apart from "copy catting" where one OS manufacturer will copy the ideas of another, why do these elements keep coming up?

- One of the fundamental principles of the Graphical User Interface is based on the idea of how young children learn. Thus, the focus of the GUI is more based on hand-eye coordination than use of command languages or other skills that require more mature skill sets.

-While we take much of this for granted, we have become dependent on these interfaces. If you have ever struggled with the menus of a digital TV service or any other interface that is not optimally designed, you will be aware of how important the user interface is.

-A user interface may be broken down into different types of functionality, or how a user uses an interface. These include input controls, where the user may enter information or respond to content; navigational components, which allow the user to transverse the interface and "get to where she wants to go"; and informational components, which impart information to the user.
