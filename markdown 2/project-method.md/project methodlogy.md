# Project Manager

A project manager’s role is to ensure that all stakeholders in the project are kept informed regularly about the progress of the project. The stakeholders can range from:

- Executives
- Business Head of Departments
- Technical Heads of Departments
- Financial Managers

## Project Team

- As you can see from the above list, the stakeholders vary, and each stakeholder is only concerned with how the project affects their department. Therefore, it is very important for a project manager to deliver updates which are understandable to all parties.

## Systems development life cycle (SDLC)

### Project management in the SDLC has 4 phases, namely:

- Requirements
- Design
- Construction
- Implementation
- Each of the different phases above has their own role player who contributes to the successful execution of the project.

### Requirements

- When planning a project, it’s vital to know what the requirements are for the project. What are the ‘must-haves’ for the project, and what are ‘nice-to-haves’. These requirements are gathered by talking to the stakeholders.

### Produce Functional Specifications

- The functional spec will contain all the necessary details needed for the developers to develop the system according to the requirements of the customer.

- A functional spec should tell the developers what to build and code; tell those testing the solution what it's supposed to do; and let the client/stakeholder know what they're going to be receiving.
- There are a few ways of writing functional specifications, and we’ll discuss three different approaches below.

### System Must

For a contact form, the functional requirements might be:

- The system must allow the user to input text.
- The system must validate the email address.

#### Use case

- A use case put functionalities into a series of steps which allows developers to get a more rounded perspective of the requirements. Often ‘system must’ requirements are formulated into a use case.

### User stories

> User stories give great insight into the user’s perspective for identifying functionalities. It uses a simple construction which makes it easy to access for developers and stakeholders alike and lets them decide what is and isn’t important for the user.

#### A common construction of a user story is:

- “As a < type of user >, I can < perform an action > so that < I can get a benefit >”

- As a potential customer I can send valid form data so that I can find out more about the product

### Design

- This document is created to show how the system will be designed and developed and becomes very useful when many systems are being integrated.

## Construction

#### Build System Components

- Once we have completed the functional and technical requirements for the system design, we can start developing. The developer will now use the functional and technical specifications to build the system based on the requirements.

### System Testing

- Once the developer has completed the development, the developer will do systems testing in order to make sure that the solution they built is working. This is done before the developer hands the system over to the testers, who will then perform full testing.

- It is good practice for the developer to test the solution while they are developing in order to fix any bugs which might be found and can then be fixed right there and then. It is also good practice for the developer to sit with the business analyst to test the solution. This will ensure that the requirements have been met.

### Produce Technical Documentation

- Once the developer has finalized the development and development testing, they will create or update the technical documentation. This is updated regularly as system and code changes are done. This is a very good document to have as any developer can use it as a point of reference for developing and allowing the developer to understand the system better.

### Implementation

- During the Implementation phase, the product is created. This means the product finally becomes tangible, and this can be an exciting milestone for the customer. This phase includes testing and installation - all while following the technical specification document.

### What is Agile?

- The English definition of "agile" means to move quickly or at a rapid pace. In terms on software development, the term "Agile" is used for iterative development.

- One example of a business using Agile is Spotify. Spotify has some big competitors and is made up of many teams across worldwide locations. They constantly have to be on top of their game to be better than the competition and - because they use Agile and specifically Scrum, which we will learn about later - they are able to continually develop and push out new software without disturbing other teams or waiting on documentation.

**The 12 principles of Agile**

#### The Agile software development manifesto is based on 12 principles of Agile, which are:

- Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
  Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
- Close, daily cooperation between businesspeople and developers
  Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
- Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
  Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential
- Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from - self-organizing teams
- Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

### Scrum

Scrum is a project management method used within the Agile framework and is one of the most widely used project method frameworks. Scrum is used when the scope of the project is not clearly defined and when there are many complexities.

### Scrum roles

Like in the traditional project management methodology, Scrum also has a set of roles which are linked to responsibilities. The Scrum roles are as follows:

- Product owner – 1 person and usually a representative from business
- Scrum master – 1 person who is the Scrum Coach and assists the team to reach their goals
- Development team – usually between 3 – 9 people.

### Product owner

The product owner is a representative from a business who is responsible for the product backlog. They usually prioritize the product backlog and will determine which user stories are of importance to the business. Product owners understand the business and can easily translate the requirement from the business to the development team.

Scrum master
The Scrum master fully understands the Scrum process and tries to facilitate and help the development team in understanding the Scrum processes by training and coaching the team. The Scrum master also assists the product owner by constantly giving regular feedback on the development process.
The Scrum master usually forms part of the development team. The Scrum master can also be part of more than one project at a time.
Development team
The development team is responsible for the delivery of the product backlog. The development team manages their own time and is not driven by orders given. User stories which are assigned to the development team during the sprint planning are to be completed at the end of every sprint. All members in the development team are responsible for the successful delivery of the user stories in the sprint, even though some of the user stories are assigned to only one person.
Scrum events
Now that we have a better understanding of the Scrum team, let's have a look at the different events in Scrum in more detail.

### Sprint

> One development cycle in Scrum is called a "sprint". Projects are delivered incrementally in Scrum and these are referred to as sprints. Unlike the traditional software development life cycle where a project is delivered as a whole, Scrum uses iterations to deliver sprints. The project is broken down into smaller, manageable pieces. A sprint can range between 2 to 4 weeks. The sprint is the container for the 4 other Scrum events.

#### Sprint review

At the end of each sprint, the Scrum team meets with the stakeholders to discuss the product backlog items which have been completed during the sprint and marked as “done”.

#### Sprint retrospective

Before a new sprint begins, the Scrum team has a meeting to discuss and give feedback on the sprint which they have just completed. In this meeting, the process of the sprint and any lessons learnt during the sprint is discussed.

### Kanban and User Stories

The toughest part of a project is always how to start, prioritize, and when to finish a project. Introduced by the Japanese in the automotive industry to manage the workflow, Kanban is a workflow process which assists in how to run a project. It helps in starting, analyzing, improving and finalizing projects by using a workflow method. The Kanban method is a visual tool to see what exactly is being worked on during a project. Kanban also manages the Work in Progress limits (WIP).

Kanban Workflow
A basic workflow in Kanban looks like this:

Kanban values, principles and agenda

The general practices of Kanban
As Kanban is a workflow system, there are general practices used to make the workflow visible and manageable. The general practices are as follows:
Visualize
Limit work in progress
Manage flow
Make policies explicit
Implement feedback loops
Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally

### User stories, epics, themes and features

When planning a project, it’s important that we understand what needs to be done and why. This requires both a high-level and low-level view. Using Themes and Epics allow us to get a high-level view of our tasks, while features and user stories let us get more specific and detailed about exactly what must be achieved.

### User story

We covered user stories earlier when discussing functional specifications, but to recap, a user story is a short description - usually from a user to the system - to describe what they need to be enhanced or fixed by the system. The user will describe it as:

- Role of the user
- What they want
- Why they want it

User stories are normally written down on sticky note sized sheets. They are stuck on a board for everyone to see and are then discussed in detail.

### Theme

A theme is a collection of stories within a category and often has organization-wide importance and is generally quite broad in its focus. An example of a theme might be ‘customer contact’.

#### This theme can then be broken down into Epics.

### Epic

An epic is a large user story. It is the full requirement which needs to be broken down in smaller parts for development. An example of an epic would be:

- As a customer I can get in contact with the business via the website so that I can find out about the product.

- A feature is a distinct element of functionality which can provide capabilities to the business.

- Our Epic of getting in contact via the website can then be broken down into features like including a contact form or adding a live chat widget to the site. It generally takes many iterations to deliver a feature.

### User Story

> A user story is a part of the feature. By splitting a feature into smaller stories, the user can give early feedback to the developers on issues quickly. The user stories can then be broken down further into tasks that the developers need to complete.
